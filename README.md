# 🚀 Optimal Travel Route Finder using Dynamic Programming 

A modern and interactive **JavaFX application** that determines the **minimum-cost travel route** between cities using the **Dynamic Programming** approach (Floyd–Warshall Algorithm).  
The project elegantly combines **algorithmic problem-solving** with a **visualized, animated UI**, making complex path optimization both efficient and easy to understand.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project solves the problem of finding the **minimum travel cost** from a starting city to a destination city.  
Each connection between cities has two types of costs:
- 🚗 **Petrol cost**
- 🏨 **Hotel cost**

The application computes the **optimal route** that minimizes the total travel expense using **Dynamic Programming**, and also displays **alternative routes**, as well as the full **DP cost table** in a user-friendly interface.
